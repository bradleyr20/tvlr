		<h3>Channels and Subchannels</h3>
	
		<p>Each published piece of content must have at least one <strong>primary channel</strong>. Content can have additional channels, but primary channel ist dominant and determinative as to display rules, content bucketing, and rendering logic (depending on use case).</p>
		
		<p>NB: Channel and Subchannel names are subject to change.</p>
		
		<p>Channels is a controlled and finite set.</p>
		
		<p>Subchannels is a controlled but infinite set. There is no set number. They can be created by editorial staff at will, but there is a managed process for this which requires approvals. Software should control for duplication, ie through autocomplete, in order to keep data as clean as possible.</p>
		
		<p>Subchannels will be loosely associated with channels, but not restrictively so. They are ontological rather than taxonomic. For example, a story tagged with the &#8220;Architecture&#8221; keyword might be assigned to primary channel &#8220;Arts &amp; Culture&#8221;, or it might be assigned to primary channel &#8220;Style &amp; Design&#8221;.</p>
